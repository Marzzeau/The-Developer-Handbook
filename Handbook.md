# The developer handbook.
The goal of this project is to make learning the different concepts of programming easy and accessible. Ungatekeep education !
## Basics
```
The roots of what programming is.
```
- What is a program?
  - Web definition: a series of coded software instructions to control the operation of a computer or other machine.
  - My definition: rules for a running instance of code
- Source code vs Executable
  - Source Code: The rules
  - Executable: The thing defined by the rules that you can run
- Compiler vs interpreter
  - Compiler translates the entire program at once into machine code (faster executable/execution)
  - Interpreter translates and executes code line-by-line (more flexible -> more about this later && slower code).
- Comments
  - Notes left for the programmers, green in most IDEs
- Indentation
  - Whitespace in code for readability.
